What are some ways that you implemented responsive design?

Responsive design Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.

Techniques: 
Add responsive meta tags in your HTML document 
Apply media queries to your layout 
Make images and embedded videos responsive
Ensure your typography will be easily readable on mobile devices. Is appearance readable?


How do use media query for images?
@media screen and (max-width:800px) { 
    body { 
        font-size:0.8em; 
    }
    img { 
        width:300px; 
    }
}

You can see in the landing.component.css that we designed for mobile first.  We used media queries to change layout as we increase screen width above 768px.



2. Is your project using any CSS transitions or Angular animations?

CSS Transitions

3. Are there any imported fonts in this project? If so, what are they and how did you import and use them?

Yes

4. What different unit(s) of measurement are you using for your font sizes?

5. What is the importance of the viewport meta tag? Specifically, why do we need this in our HTML?
<metaname="viewport"content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0">
The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.
You should include the following <meta> element in all your web pages:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
6. How are you defining your media queries? With min-width or max-width? What is the difference between the two?

Min-width 
Mobile design you design for cell phone size first.  Then if your screen is larger than a cell phone, you use your media query for the larger screen options.
